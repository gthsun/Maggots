Final coding project of AP Computer Science in my senior year of high school. It is a simple demake of the hit game 'Worms' with a physics engine, map generation, and custom sprites and animations.

## Credit
Huge credit to Michael Jenkins, who I collaborated with for this project. He handled major coding issues while I handled smaller issues and the art.
